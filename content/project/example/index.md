Hong Kong, as a world-renowned tourist destination, has naturally become the first choice for many tourists. To better serve this wave of the tourism boom, we used SQL database technology to create a user-friendly query system to analyse Airbnb-related data in Hong Kong. This system is designed to help users efficiently filter out the most popular room types and the neighbourhoods in which they are located while also exploring the correlation between specific room types and reviews, the number of days booked, and the number of reviews. This system will significantly facilitate the editor's conveniently generating reports, helping readers make
accommodation choices faster and more accurately.

Using automated content management systems to process and analyse Airbnb data through in-depth analysis of Airbnb Hong Kong listings, user reviews, host information and location data, we can have a clearer understanding of user preferences, price trends, service quality and other indicators. And make some templates to store this information in a database that will be used in standard reports.

Based on the survey, it can be found that the most popular Airbnb listing in Hong Kong in 2023 was the Rental unit in Hong Kong, which received 501 items of reviews, and you can search it by id:850531. When you enter the id: 17891, what is concerned the most is that the price of this listing is 1400, with an Entire home/apt room type. Besides, When you want to book a private room, you can know in advance that you need to book this room type for at least 21 nights.
